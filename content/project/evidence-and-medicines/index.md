A key theme in the philosophy of medicine examines the ways in which evidence *should* inform decisions---individual therapeutic decisions, guideline development and regulatory decisions.

In broad terms, this project seeks to address some of the following questions:

* What is the relationship between different types of biomedical evidence, including the mechanisms of basic medical science, evidence from randomized studies and the outputs of modelling and simulation approaches?
* How should we characterise “causation” in the biomedical sciences? What types of evidence give good grounds for inferring causal relationships?
* What are the barriers in translating advances in the basic sciences to improvements in health?—how do we overcome them?
* What conditions are necessary for a successful confirmatory randomized trial?
* When are randomized trials ethically permissible?
