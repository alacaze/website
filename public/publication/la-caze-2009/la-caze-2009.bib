 abstract = {Proponents of evidence-based medicine (EBM) provide the “ hierar- chy of evidence ” as a criterion for judging the reliability of thera- peutic decisions. EBM's hierarchy places randomized interventional studies (and systematic reviews of such studies) higher in the hierarchy than observational studies, unsystematic clinical experi- ence, and basic science. Recent philosophical work has questioned whether EBM's special emphasis on evidence from randomized interventional studies can be justifi ed. Following the critical litera- ture, and in particular the work of John Worrall, I agree that many of the arguments put forward by advocates of EBM do not justify the ambitious claims that are often made on behalf of randomiza- tion. However, in contrast to the recent philosophical work, I argue that a justifi cation for EBM's hierarchy of evidence can be pro- vided. The hierarchy should be viewed as a hierarchy of compara- tive internal validity. Although this justifi cation is defensible, the claims that EBM's hierarchy substantiates when viewed in this way are considerably more circumscribed than some claims found in the EBM literature},
