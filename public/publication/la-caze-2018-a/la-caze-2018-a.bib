 abstract = {The standard way in which directions are represented on dispensing labels can be misinterpreted. Errors in interpreting instructions are more common in people with low health literacy and when the timing of administration is not specified. Improving written communication on prescriptions and dispensing labels can reduce medication errors. There is an emerging international consensus on best-practice communication on dispensing labels.},
