You need your own version of the APF. Always use current editions of resources when assessing doses.  Overall Process with Worked Example Overall Process Determine drug, form, dose, duration Then ask:\n Who is the patient? What is the indication? What is the recommended dose? Assess the recommended dose against the prescribed dose Are there additional considerations?  Worked Example Kathryn is a 4 year-old with a cold. She has just seen the GP who suggested Paracetamol Elixir 240mg/5mL, 5mL q4\u0026ndash;6h prn.\nKathryn weighs 16kg.\nUse the AMH to determine whether this is an appropriate dose for Kathryn before going to the next slide Step 1 Who is the patient? The patient is a 4 year-old child.\nDosing in children often depends on the child\u0026rsquo;s weight. Kathryn\u0026rsquo;s weight is 16kg\nStep 2 What is the indication?\nKathryn is being given paracetamol for discomfort and increased temperature related to a cold.\nIndication can be important for assessing dosing. Knowing that the paracetamol is for a cold tells you that Kathryn\u0026rsquo;s symptoms are unlikely to be severe.\nStep 3 What is the recommended dose?\nIt is important to read the paracetamol dose carefully. It is easy to misunderstand the information provided (especially in relation to maximum dosing) __AMH__: 15mg/kg every 4--6 hours (a single dose of 30 mg/kg may be used for night-time dosing) Contrast this with the paracetamol dose provided in the APF\n Step 3 (continued) Calculate the recommended dose for Kathryn\nKathryn is 16kg, therefore:\n15 mg/kg x 16 kg = 240mg every 4\u0026ndash;6 hours\n What is the maximum dose you could give Kathryn?   Step 4 Assess the recommended dose against the prescribed dose\nPrescribed dose Paracetamol 240mg/5mL, 5mL q4\u0026ndash;6h prn = 240mg q4\u0026ndash;6h prn Recommended dose AMH: 15mg/kg every 4\u0026ndash;6 hours = 15 mg/kg x 16 kg = 240mg every 4\u0026ndash;6 hours\nStep 4 (continued) The dose is appropriate.\nNote, that the AMH doesn\u0026rsquo;t specify \u0026ldquo;prn\u0026rdquo;.\nThe indication and context of use tells us that \u0026ldquo;prn\u0026rdquo; is appropriate.\nStep 5 Additional considerations\nAn important additional consideration for paracetamol dosing is clearly communicating maximum doses.\nThe maximum dose for Kathryn is __60mg/kg per day for up to 48 hours__\nKey aspects: Kathryn is medically unsupervised; her indication doesn't warrant extended high doses. A good way to communicate this would be: Give Kathryn 5mL by measure every FOUR to SIX hours if she needs it. Take care not to give her more than FOUR doses in 24 hours.\n General Considerations ##\nThe following provides general guidance on assessing a prescribed dose.\nThis gets easier as you gain knowledge of the condition being treated and the ways that condition is managed.\nThe indication matters Many drugs have multiple indications; sometimes the dose between indications can vary greatly.\nKnowing why the drug is being used will aid decisions.\nThe dosing advice you provide a mother of a 3 year-old prescribed paracetamol for mild fever associated with the common cold __should__ be different to the advice you provide the mother of a 3 year-old child suffering the pain of a middle ear infection.\nInitial or continuing therapy? Is this the first time the patient has used this medicine?\nSometimes doses start high and are reduced. More often doses start low and are gradually increased.\nWhether or not the patient has taken this medication before will often influence whether the dose is appropriate.\nLook up carbamazepine in the AMH. Note the first __Practice point__.\nThe patient matters Is the patient young or old? Over- or underweight? Pregnant or breastfeeding?\nSome drugs are dosed similarly for large groups of different patients. Other drugs are dosed very specifically.\nContrast the dosing advice provided for loratadine and methotrexate.\nNOTE: methotrexate has multiple entries in the AMH based on indication.\nThe patient matters (cont.) Can the patient administer the dose you are suggesting?\nDoes a product exist that provides the dose in a way that is feasible?\nOlder children might prefer a tablet to a liquid.\nMany people, young and old, experience difficulty swallowing. They might prefer a liquid if it is available.\nPharmacokinetics matters as does pharmacodynamics Is the drug renally cleared? (Does the patient have renal impairment?)\nDose adjustment might be necessary in renal impairment\nLook up colchicine\nDoes effectiveness depend on peak concentrations, trough concentrations or steady state levels?\nThe best examples here are antibiotics and anticonvulsants. Depending on the drug you might be targeting peak, trough or steady state concentations.\nPharmacokinetics matters as does pharmacodynamics (cont) Are side effects expected at the start of treatment? Do we \u0026ldquo;start low and go slow\u0026rdquo; with dose escalation?\nThis might depend on the indication.\nStarting an opioid for chronic pain is often a matter of \"start low and go slow\"\nStarting an opioid for acute pain due to trauma is a matter of \"start high and reduce when possible\"\nKey reference texts differ Key dosing references are AMH, APF, e-TG and MIMS (understand how they differ). It may be necessary to refer to each of them (or at least more than one).\nWhen references give conflicting advice, often the best way to resolve it is to think through some of the general principles listed above.\nSometimes scheduling matters There are a number of Pharmacist or Pharmacy Only drugs that we discuss this semester that are scheduled according to their dose and pack size (e.g. ibuprofen).\nIf you rely on the AMH or APF dose (as opposed to the MIMS dose of the appropriate product) you may be suggesting a dose that is scheduled Prescription Only.\nKnow your resources    Resources Strengths     AMH Clinical guidance on prescription medicines    Yearly update    Local    Involvement of key professional bodies   APF Similar to AMH, though less frequently updated    Pharmacy focus   MIMS Registered product information (but can be out of date)    Only resource that covers over-the-counter products well   e-TG Focus on clinical conditions    Dosing advice in less common conditions    Table: Key strengths of common dosing resources\nConclusion The best way to improve your ability to assess doses is to practice.\nDo the quiz!\n","date":1561939200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1561939200,"objectID":"94c27733e998448706bb00c43fb720d1","permalink":"/teaching/example/posology/","publishdate":"2019-07-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/teaching/example/posology/","section":"teaching","summary":"Background  Posology: that part of medicine concerned with dosage\n Learning Objectives  Develop a process for determining an appropriate dose for a patient Know the strengths and weaknesses of key pharmacy dosing resources Judiciously apply general principles for assessing whether a patient\u0026rsquo;s dose is appropriate  The drugs mentioned as examples are drugs you need to know for PHRM2011\nLearning Resources  AMH APF, including \u0026ldquo;Dose calculations for children\u0026rdquo; MIMS online e-TG http://www.","tags":["teaching","PHRM2011"],"title":"Example Page 2","type":"docs"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" Here are some more tips for getting started with Academic:\nTip 3 Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.

The book focuses in particular on the diverse sources of uncertainty, the different kinds of uncertainty that there are, and the diverse ways in which these uncertainties are (or could be) addressed. Compared with the more basic sciences, such as chemistry or biology, pharmacology works across diverse observable levels of reality: although the first step in the causal chain leading to the therapeutic outcome takes place at the biochemical level, the end-effect is a clinically observable result—which is influenced not only by biological actions, but also psychological and social phenomena. Issues of causality and evidence must be treated with these specific aspects in mind. In covering these issues, the book opens up a common domain of investigation which intersects the deeply intertwined dimensions of pharmacological research, pharmaceutical regulation and the related economic environment. The book is a collective endeavour with in-depth contributions from experts in pharmacology, philosophy of medicine, statistics, scientific methodology, formal and social epistemology, working in constant dialogue across disciplinary boundaries.","tags":["Evidence and medicines"],"title":"Uncertainty in Pharmacology: Epistemology, Methods and Decisions","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" This project is funded by an APSA Grant (2019).\nCo-investigators are Amber Salman Popattia and Laetitia Hattingh.\nSynopsis Many consumers choose to use complementary medicines and frequently purchase their complementary medicines from community pharmacy. Pharmacists tend to vary in their approach to the sale of complementary medicines and recent media reports suggest that some pharmacies are failing to meet community expectations regarding the advice they provide. There is a need for clearer guidance for pharmacists regarding their responsibilities when selling complementary medicines. The investigators have developed an ethical framework for the sale of complementary medicines in community pharmacy. This project seeks to extend this work by evaluating the acceptability and feasibility of implementing the guidance provided by the ethical framework. Australian community pharmacists will be recruited to participate in focus groups. Focus groups will provide an opportunity to examine group views regarding current practice and to identify organisational, professional and personal barriers and facilitators to implementing the ethical framework in practice. The findings from this study will be used to further develop the ethical framework. Practice change will be facilitated by the production of two reports regarding the responsibilities of pharmacists when selling complementary medicines. The first report will provide policy-level guidance for key professional and regulatory organisations. The second report will provide tools for practitioners to implement the ethical framework in practice.\n","date":1562284800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1562284800,"objectID":"eea55288053f2c4ddcc6d62b5f30a940","permalink":"/project/cm-ethics-apsa/","publishdate":"2019-07-05T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/cm-ethics-apsa/","section":"project","summary":"Evaluating pharmacist responsibilities when selling complementary medicines","tags":["Pharmacy ethics"],"title":"Pharmacy ethics and complementary medicines","type":"project"},{"authors":["Adam La Caze"],"categories":null,"content":"The paper on which this talk is based is currently a work-in-progress.\n","date":1562198400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1562198400,"objectID":"5b84695a4daeda26b21773c53421d853","permalink":"/talk/blackbox-presentation/","publishdate":"2019-06-20T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/blackbox-presentation/","section":"talk","summary":"Randomized trials are frequently treated as if they are a black box, but they are not.","tags":["Evidence and Medicines"],"title":"Randomized trials are not black boxes","type":"talk"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"A key theme in the philosophy of medicine examines the ways in which evidence should inform decisions\u0026mdash;individual therapeutic decisions, guideline development and regulatory decisions.\nIn broad terms, this project seeks to address some of the following questions:\n What is the relationship between different types of biomedical evidence, including the mechanisms of basic medical science, evidence from randomized studies and the outputs of modelling and simulation approaches?

The EBM+ programme seeks to redress this imbalance, by suggesting methods for evaluating mechanistic studies alongside clinical studies. Drug approval is a problematic case for the view that mechanistic evidence should be taken into account, because RCTs are almost always available. Nevertheless, we argue that mechanistic evidence is central to all the key tasks in the drug approval process: in drug discovery and development; assessing pharmaceutical quality; devising dosage regimens; assessing efficacy, harms, external validity, and cost‐effectiveness; evaluating adherence; and extending product licences. We recommend that, when preparing for meetings in which any aspect of drug approval is to be discussed, mechanistic evidence should be systematically analysed and presented to the committee members alongside analyses of clinical studies.","tags":["Evidence and medicines"],"title":"The use of mechanistic evidence in drug approval","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Holly Foot","Adam La Caze","Peter Baker","Neil Cottrell"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1514728800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1561696862,"objectID":"d34878b63b31971704ccf5875a0ccb09","permalink":"/publication/foot-2018/","publishdate":"2018-01-01T00:00:00+10:00","relpermalink":"/publication/foot-2018/","section":"publication","summary":"Objective: The aim was to better understand how beliefs influence medication adherence in asthma. Methods: All participants were prescribed an inhaled corticosteroid for a diagnosis of asthma. Each participant completed a survey consisting of: Beliefs about Medicines Questionnaire (BMQ), Brief-Illness Perception Questionnaire (B-IPQ) and Multi-dimensional Health Locus of Control Scale (MHLCS). Adherence to inhaled corticosteroids was elicited using the Medication Adherence Report Scale (MARS). Multiple linear regression with interaction effects was used to identify significant predictors of medication adherence and interactions between beliefs. Results: A total of 198 participants completed the survey. The mean($±$SD) MARS score was 19.2($±$4.5). A multivariable model (adjusted R2 = 0.39) predicted adherence using: age, asthma hospitalisation, timeline (B-IPQ) subscale, necessity and concern (BMQ) subscales, doctor (MHLCS) subscale and the two interaction effects (concerns [BMQ] moderated by chance [MHLCS] and treatment control [B-IPQ] moderated by understanding [B-IPQ]). Conclusion: The findings of this study contribute to a better understanding of the role of beliefs in medication adherence in asthma. Certain beliefs meaningfully interrelate and change the relationship they have with medication adherence. Practice Implications: If these beliefs are causally related to medication adherence and can be intervened upon, the findings are useful for providing targets to personalise adherence support.","tags":["Asthma","Beliefs","Beliefs about medicines","Illness perceptions","Locus of control beliefs","Medication adherence"],"title":"Better understanding the influence and complexity of beliefs on medication adherence in asthma","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Amber Salman Popattia","Sarah Winch","Adam La Caze"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1514728800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1561696862,"objectID":"ff30e5899fdda492a04c211b2fcd8608","permalink":"/publication/salman-popattia-2018/","publishdate":"2018-01-01T00:00:00+10:00","relpermalink":"/publication/salman-popattia-2018/","section":"publication","summary":"**Objective**\nThe widespread sale of complementary medicines in community pharmacy raises important questions regarding the responsibilities of pharmacists when selling complementary medicines. This study reviews the academic literature that explores a pharmacist's responsibilities when selling complementary medicines.\n\n**Methods**\nInternational Pharmaceutical Abstracts, Embase, PubMed, Cinahl, PsycINFO and Philosopher's index databases were searched for articles written in English and published between 1995 and 2017. Empirical studies discussing pharmacists’ practices or perceptions, consumers’ expectations and normative studies discussing ethical perspectives or proposing ethical frameworks related to pharmacists’ responsibilities in selling complementary medicines were included in the review.\n\n**Key findings**\nFifty‐eight studies met the inclusion criteria. The majority of the studies discussing the responsibilities of pharmacists selling complementary medicines had an empirical focus. Pharmacists and consumers identified counselling and ensuring safe use of complementary medicines as the primary responsibilities of pharmacists. No formal ethical framework is explicitly employed to describe the responsibilities of pharmacists selling complementary medicines. To the degree any ethical framework is employed, a number of papers implicitly rely on principlism. The studies discussing the ethical perspectives of selling complementary medicines mainly describe the ethical conflict between a pharmacist's business and health professional role. No attempt is made to provide guidance on appropriate ways to resolve the conflict.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThere is a lack of explicit normative advice in the existing literature regarding the responsibilities of pharmacists selling complementary medicines. This review identifies the need to develop a detailed practice‐specific ethical framework to guide pharmacists regarding their responsibilities when selling complementary medicines.","tags":null,"title":"Ethical responsibilities of pharmacists when selling complementary medicines: a systematic review","type":"publication"},{"authors":["A.

The absence of rigorous evidence for the effectiveness of many complementary medicines raises a number of ethical questions regarding the sale of complementary medicines in pharmacies. AIM: Explore (1) what consumers expect from pharmacists/pharmacies with regard to the sale of complementary medicines, and (2) how pharmacy support staff perceive their responsibilities when selling complementary medicines. METHODS: One-on-one semi-structured interviews were conducted with a convenience sample of pharmacy support staff and consumers in pharmacies in Brisbane. Consumers were asked to describe their expectations when purchasing complementary medicines. Pharmacy support staff were asked to describe their responsibilities when selling complementary medicines. Interviews were conducted and analysed using the techniques developed within Grounded Theory. KEY FINDINGS: Thirty-three consumers were recruited from three pharmacies. Consumers described complementary medicine use as a personal health choice. Consumer expectations on the pharmacist included: select the right product for the right person, expert product knowledge and maintaining a wide range of good quality stock. Twenty pharmacy support staff were recruited from four pharmacies. Pharmacy support staff employed processes to ensure consumers receive the right product for the right person. Pharmacy support staff expressed a commitment to aiding consumers, but few evaluated the reliability of effectiveness claims regarding complementary medicines. CONCLUSIONS: Pharmacists need to respect the personal health choices of consumers while also putting procedures in place to ensure safe and appropriate use of complementary medicines. This includes providing appropriate support to pharmacy support staff.","tags":["Complementary medicines","Ethics","Pharmacist responsibility","Pharmacy","Pharmacy support staff","complementary medicines","responsibility"],"title":"Expectations and responsibilities regarding the sale of complementary medicines in pharmacies: perspectives of consumers and pharmacy support staff","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Adam La Caze"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1483192800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1561696862,"objectID":"1f7d654d04c2186eebb43775f1c18b4f","permalink":"/publication/rout-philof-med/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00+10:00","relpermalink":"/publication/rout-philof-med/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":["Evidence and medicines"],"title":"The randomized controlled trial: internal and external validity","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Thi-My-Uyen Nguyen","Adam La Caze","Neil Cottrell"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1477922400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1561696862,"objectID":"55da1353b44020b0c0df0e6235f7c2b3","permalink":"/publication/nguyen-2016/","publishdate":"2016-11-01T00:00:00+10:00","relpermalink":"/publication/nguyen-2016/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":["adherence_pub"],"title":"Validated adherence scales used in a measurement-guided medication management approach to target and tailor a medication adherence intervention: a randomised controlled trial","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1461715200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1561696862,"objectID":"d1311ddf745551c9e117aa4bb7e28516","permalink":"/project/external-project/","publishdate":"2016-04-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/external-project/","section":"project","summary":"An example of linking directly to an external project website using `external_link`.","tags":["Demo"],"title":"External Project","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.

In some, community pharmacists have sessional contracts to provide medication management services to inpatients. This paper discusses the funding arrangements of identified sessional employment models to raise awareness of options for other rural hospitals. Methods Semistructured one-on-one interviews were conducted with rural pharmacists with experience in a sessional employment role (n=8) or who were seeking sessional arrangements (n=4). Participants were identified via publicity and referrals. Interviews were conducted via telephone or Skype for ̃40-55min each, recorded and analysed descriptively. Results A shortage of state funding and reliance on federal funding was reported. Pharmacists accredited to provide medication reviews claimed remuneration via these federal schemes; however, restrictive criteria limited their scope of services. Funds pooling to subsidise remuneration for the pharmacists was evident and arrangements with local community pharmacies provided business frameworks to support sessional services. Conclusion Participants were unaware of each other's models of practice, highlighting the need to share information and these findings. Several similarities existed, namely, pooling funds and use of federal medication review remuneration. Findings highlighted the need for a stable remuneration pathway and business model to enable wider implementation of sessional pharmacist models. What is known about the topic? Many rural hospitals lack an optimal workforce to provide comprehensive health services, including pharmaceutical services. One solution to address medication management shortfalls is employment of a local community pharmacist or consultant pharmacist on a sessional basis in the hospital. There is no known research into remuneration options for pharmacists providing sessional hospital services. What does this paper add? Viability of services and financial sustainability are paramount in rural healthcare. This paper describes and compares the mechanisms initiated independently by hospitals or pharmacists to meet the medication needs of rural hospital patients. Awareness of the funding arrangements provides options for health service providers to extend services to other rural communities. What are the implications for practitioners? Rural practitioners who identify unmet service needs may be inspired to explore funding arrangements successfully implemented by our participants. Innovative use of existing funding schemes has potential to create employment options for rural practitioners and increase provision of services in rural areas.","tags":null,"title":"Funding issues and options for pharmacists providing sessional services to rural hospitals in Australia.","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Amy Tan","Lynne M Emmerton","H Laetitia Hattingh","Adam La Caze"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1388498400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1561696862,"objectID":"dbdc0924274845ddec6a01b4e64a4363","permalink":"/publication/tan-2014/","publishdate":"2014-01-01T00:00:00+10:00","relpermalink":"/publication/tan-2014/","section":"publication","summary":"BackgroundMany rural hospitals in Australia and New Zealand do not have an on-site pharmacist. Sessional employment of a local pharmacist offers a potential solution to address the clinical service needs of non-pharmacist rural hospitals. This study explored sessional service models involving pharmacists and factors (enablers and challenges) impacting on these models, with a view to informing future sessional employment.MethodsA series of semi-structured one-on-one interviews was conducted with rural pharmacists with experience, or intention to practise, in a sessional employment role in Australia and New Zealand. Participants were identified via relevant newsletters, discussion forums and referrals from contacts. Interviews were conducted during August 2012-January 2013 via telephone or Skype¿, for approximately 40¿55 minutes each, and recorded.ResultsSeventeen pharmacists were interviewed: eight with ongoing sessional roles, five with sessional experience, and four working towards sessional employment. Most participants provided sessional hospital services on a weekly basis, mainly focusing on inpatient medication review and consultation. Recognition of the value of pharmacists¿ involvement and engagement with other healthcare providers facilitated establishment and continuity of sessional services. Funds pooled from various sources supplemented some pharmacists¿ remuneration in the absence of designated government funding. Enhanced employment opportunities, district support and flexibility in services facilitated the continuous operation of the sessional service.ConclusionsThere is potential to address clinical pharmacy service needs in rural hospitals by cross-sector employment of pharmacists. The reported sessional model arrangements, factors impacting on sessional employment of pharmacists and learnings shared by the participants should assist development of similar models in other rural communities.","tags":null,"title":"Cross-sector, sessional employment of pharmacists in rural hospitals in Australia and New Zealand: a qualitative study exploring pharmacists' perceptions and experiences.","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Adam La Caze","Gina Gujral","William Neil Cottrell"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1388498400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1561696862,"objectID":"806d1a3608b0763d5ca370fdcb0a0105","permalink":"/publication/la-caze-2014-gc/","publishdate":"2014-01-01T00:00:00+10:00","relpermalink":"/publication/la-caze-2014-gc/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"How do we better translate adherence research into improvements in patient care?","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Suvimol Niyomnaitham","Andrew Page","Adam La Caze","Karen Whitfield","Alesha J Smith"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1388498400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1561696862,"objectID":"239bb694b9788dcc0a751e11a27e81b2","permalink":"/publication/niyomnaitham-2014/","publishdate":"2014-01-01T00:00:00+10:00","relpermalink":"/publication/niyomnaitham-2014/","section":"publication","summary":"BACKGROUND: A see on cardiovascular diseases and bladder cancer. The changes to the patterns of rosiglitazone and pioglitazone utilisation in Australia following the timing of these various health authority warnings such as the Australian Therapeutic Good Administration (TGA), European Medicines Agency (EMA) press releases or U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is unknown. This study investigated the utilisation patterns of rosiglitazone and pioglitazone in Australia before and after warnings of major drug authorities. METHODS: We evaluated rosiglitazone and pioglitazone dispensing using the Pharmaceutical Benefit Scheme (PBS) subsidised drug dispensing data for the Australian population from February 2004 to July 2012. The World Health Organisation Anatomic Therapeutic Chemical (ATC)/Defined Daily Dose (DDD) system was used to compare the drug utilisation patterns following the announcements of EMA, FDA, and TGA safety warnings, which first occurred in May 2007. The DDD/1000 population/day were examined in a series of time-series regression analysis with the drug safety warnings specified as interventions. RESULTS: Rosiglitazone utilisation increased steadily from 2004 until reaching a peak at 1.96/1000 population/day in January 2007. Then rosiglitazone use decreased significantly after the initial EMA press release and FDA warning on cardiovascular risk in May 2007 (with a 15.04% average monthly decline, p-value ","tags":["Adverse Drug Reaction Reporting Systems","Australia","Australia: epidemiology","Diabetes Mellitus","Type 2","Diabetes Mellitus","Type 2: drug therapy","Drug Interactions","Humans","Hypoglycemic Agents","Hypoglycemic Agents: adverse effects","Hypoglycemic Agents: therapeutic use","Risk","Risk Factors","Thiazolidinediones","Thiazolidinediones: adverse effects","Thiazolidinediones: therapeutic use"],"title":"Utilisation trends of rosiglitazone and pioglitazone in Australia before and after safety warnings.","type":"publication"},{"authors":["T.
